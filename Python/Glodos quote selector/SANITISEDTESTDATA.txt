portal 2

hello and again welcome to the aperture science computer-aided enrichment center
we hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one
your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper
before we start however keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of all enrichment center activities serious injuries may occur
for your own safety and the safety of others please refrain from-- bzzzzzt
por favor bordón de fallar muchos gracias de fallar gracias
stand back the portal will open in three two one
excellent please proceed into the chamberlock after completing each test
first however note the incandescent particle field across the exit
this aperture science material emancipation grill will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it - for instance the aperture science weighted storage cube
if the player manages to take a cube into the material emancipation grill while the door is open
please place the weighted storage cube on the fifteen hundred megawatt aperture science heavy duty super-colliding super button
perfect please move quickly to the chamberlock as the effects of prolonged exposure to the button are not part of this test
youre doing very well
please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the aperture science material emancipation grill which may in semi- rare cases emancipate dental fillings crowns tooth enamel and teeth

very good you are now in possession of the aperture science handheld portal device
with it you can create your own portals
these intra-dimensional gates have proven to be completely safe
the device however has not
do not touch the operational end of the device
do not look directly at the operational end of the device
do not submerge the device in liquid even partially
most importantly under no circumstances should you (static slows to a stop)
please proceed to the chamberlock mind the gap
well done remember the aperture science bring your daughter to work day is the perfect time to have her tested
welcome to test chamber four
youre doing quite well
once again excellent work
as part of a required test protocol we will not monitor the next test chamber you will be entirely on your own good luck
if the player manages to trap him/herself
as part of a required test protocol our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication
good job as part of a required test protocol we will stop enhancing the truth in three two static
while safety is one of many enrichment center goals the aperture science high energy pellet seen to the left of the chamber can and has caused permanent disabilities such as vaporization
please be careful
unbelievable you subject name here must be the pride of subject hometown here
warning devices are required on all mobile equipment however alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high energy pellet and have therefore been disabled for your safety
good now use the aperture science unstationary scaffold to reach the chamberlock
please note that we have added a consequence for failure any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record followed by death good luck
very impressive please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience
the enrichment center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible
make no attempt to solve it
during the level
the enrichment center apologizes for this clearly broken test chamber
once again the enrichment center offers its most sincere apologies on the occasion of this unsolvable test environment
frankly this chamber was a mistake if we were you we would quit now
no one will blame you for giving up in fact quitting at this point is a perfectly reasonable response
quit now and cake will be served immediately
fantastic you remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism
hello again to reiterate slows down our previous speeds up warning this test garbled speech -ward momentum
spectacular you appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum or to be more precise how it does not
momentum a function of mass and velocity is conserved between portals in laymans terms speedy-thing goes in speedy-thing comes out
the enrichment center promises to always provide a safe testing environment
in dangerous testing environments the enrichment center promises to always provide useful advice
for instance the floor here will kill you - try to avoid it
the device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once
as part of an optional test protocol we are pleased to present an amusing fact
the device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in subject hometown here
(garble) fling yourself (garble) fling into sp- bzzt
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeebzzt
now that you are in control of both portals this next test could take a very very long time
if you become light-headed from thirst feel free to pass out
an intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline
as part of a previously mentioned required test protocol we can no longer lie to you
when the testing is over you will be missed
all subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they may be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues
no further compliance information is required or will be provided and you are an excellent test subject
very very good a complimentary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber
the enrichment center is committed to the well being of all participants
cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test
thank you for helping us help you help us all
if the player is trapped in the high energy pellet receptor area
through no fault of the enrichment center you have managed to trap yourself in this room
an escape hatch will open in three two one
did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the aperture science self esteem fund for girls its true
due to mandatory scheduled maintenance the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable
it has been replaced with a live-fire course designed for military androids
the enrichment center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck
well done android the enrichment center once again reminds you that android hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance
the vital apparatus vent will deliver a weighted companion cube in three two one
this weighted companion cube will accompany you through the test chamber please take care of it
the symptoms most commonly produced by enrichment center testing are superstition perceiving inanimate objects as alive and hallucinations
the enrichment center reminds you that the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and in fact cannot speak
the enrichment center reminds you that the weighted companion cube cannot speak
in the event that the weighted companion cube does speak the enrichment center urges you to disregard its advice
you did it the weighted companion cube certainly brought you good luck
however it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and unfortunately must be euthanized
please escort your companion cube to the aperture science emergency intelligence incinerator
rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the enrichment center aperture science employees and all test subjects of any moral responsibility for the companion cube euthanizing process
while it has been a faithful companion your companion cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test if it could talk - and the enrichment center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you
testing cannot continue until your companion cube has been incinerated
although the euthanizing process is remarkably painful eight out of ten aperture science engineers believe that the companion cube is most likely incapable of feeling much pain
the companion cube cannot continue through the testing state and local statutory regulations prohibit it from simply remaining here alone and companionless you must euthanize it
destroy your companion cube or the testing cannot continue
you euthanized your faithful companion cube more quickly than any test subject on record congratulations
the experiment is nearing its conclusion
the enrichment center is required to remind you that you will be baked and then there will be cake
if a storage cube is lost in the goo at the bottom
weighted storage cube destroyed
please proceed to the aperture science vital apparatus vent for a replacement
if the player is trapped in the high energy pellet receptor area
despite the best efforts of the enrichment center staff to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities you have managed to ensnare yourself permanently inside this room
a complimentary escape hatch will open in three two one
well done be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions
for more information please attend an enrichment center electrical safety seminar
when the player picks up the morality core
the voice has subtly changed smoother more seductive less computerized
the following automatically plays or repeats after the respective speech for every destroyed core
massive
them
in regular computer voice versions with the deeper voice are used in the final game
talk

oh its you
its been a long time how have you been
ive been really busy being dead you know after you murdered me
okay look we both said a lot of things that youre going to regret but i think we can put our differences behind us for science you monster
i will say though that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up you must really really love to test
i love it too theres just one small thing we need to take care of first
here we are the incinerator room be careful not to trip over any parts of me that didnt get completely burned when you threw them down here
the dual portal device should be around here somewhere once you find it we can start testing just like old times
there it is
hold on
there
good you have a dual portal device there should be a way back to the testing area up ahead
once testing starts im required by protocol to keep interaction with you to a minimum luckily we havent started testing yet this will be our only chance to talk
here let me get that for you
do you know the biggest lesson i learned from what you did i discovered i have a sort of black-box quick-save feature in the event of a catastrophic failure the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis
i was able - well forced really - to relive you killing me again and again forever
you know if youd done that to somebody else they might devote their existence to exacting revenge
luckily im a bigger person than that im happy to put this all behind us and get back to work after all weve got a lot to do and only sixty more years to do it more or less i dont have the actuarial tables in front of me
ill just move that out of the way for you this place really is a wreck
but the important thing is youre back with me and now im onto all your little tricks so theres nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life
after thatwho knows i might take up a hobby reanimating the dead maybe
sorry about the mess ive really let the place go since you killed me by the way thanks for that
oh good thats back online ill start getting everything else working while you perform this first simple test
which involves deadly lasers and how test subjects react when locked in a room with deadly lasers
not bad i forgot how good you are at this you should pace yourself though we have a lot of tests to do
this next test involves discouragement redirection cubes id just finished building them before you had your well episode so now well both get to see how they work
there should be one in the corner
well done here come the test results you are a horrible person im serious thats what it says a horrible person we werent even testing for that
dont let that horrible person thing discourage you its just a data point if it makes you feel any better science has now validated your birth mothers decision to abandon you on a doorstep
congratulations not on the test
most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished i want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds
one moment
youre navigating these test chambers faster than i can build them so feel free to slow down and do whatever it is you do when youre not destroying this facility
ill give you credit i guess you are listening to me but for the record you dont have to go that slowly
waddle over to the elevator and well continue the testing
this next test involves the aperture science aerial faith plate it was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space results were highly informative they could not good luck
heres an interesting fact youre not breathing real air its too expensive to pump this far down we just take carbon dioxide out of a room freshen it up a little and pump it back in so youll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life i thought that was interesting
lets see what the next test is oh advanced aerial faith plates
well have fun soaring through the air without a care in the world
i have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up fifteen acres of broken glass by myself
oh sorry im still cleaning out the test chambers
so sometimes theres still trash in them standing around smelling and being useless
try to avoid the garbage hurtling towards you
if the player picks up a trash item
you dont have to test with the garbage its garbage
press the button again
remember before when i was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless that was a metaphor i was actually talking about you and im sorry you didnt react at the time so i was worried it sailed right over your head which would have made this apology seem insane thats why i had to call you garbage a second time just now
did you know that people with guilty consciences are more easily startled by loud noise--train horn--
im sorry i dont know why that went off anyway just an interesting science fact
oh did i accidentally fizzle that before you could complete the test im sorry
go ahead and grab another one
oh no i fizzled that one too
oh well we have warehouses full of the things absolutely worthless im happy to get rid of them
every test chamber is equipped with an emancipation grill at its exit so that test subjects cant smuggle test objects out of the test area this one is broken
dont take anything with you
if the player jumps down and leaves the companion cube up above
uh oh youre stranded lets see if the cube will try to help you escape actually so that were not here all day ill just cut to the chase it wont any feelings you think it has for you are simply byproducts of your sad empty life
anyway heres a new cube for you to project your deranged loneliness onto
if the player takes the companion cube past the exit
i think that one was about to say i love you they are sentient of course we just have a lot of them
this next test involves emancipation grills remember i told you about them in the last test area that did not have one
ohhh no the turbines again  i have to go  wait this next test does require some explanation let me give you the fast version
fast gibberish
there if you have any questions just remember what i said in slow motion test on your own recognizance ill be right back
well im back the aerial faith plate in here is sending a distress signal
you broke it didnt you
there try it now
hmm this plate must not be calibrated to someone of your generous ness ill add a few zeros to the maximum weight
you look great by the way very healthy
try it now
you seem to have defeated its load-bearing capacity well done ill just lower the ceiling
look at you sailing through the air majestically like an eagle piloting a blimp
enjoy this next test im going to go to the surface its a beautiful day out yesterday i saw a deer if you solve this next test maybe ill let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room and ill tell you about the time i saw a deer again
well you passed the test i didnt see the deer today i did see some humans but with you here ive got more test subjects than ill ever need
if the player manages to trap themselves by leaving the cube on the topmost floor without activating the dropper
if you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing youre sorely mistaken heres another cube
these bridges are made from natural light that i pump in from the surface if you rubbed your cheek on one it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face it would also set your hair on fire so dont actually do it
excellent youre a predator and these tests are your prey speaking of which i was researching sharks for an upcoming test do you know who else murders people who are only trying to help them
did you guess sharks because thats wrong the correct answer is nobody nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel
good news i figured out what to do with all the money i save recycling your one roomful of air when you die im going to laminate your skeleton and pose you in the lobby that way future generations can learn from you how not to have your unfortunate bone structure
perfect the doors malfunctioning i guess somebodys going to have to repair that too no dont get up ill be right back dont touch anything
i went and spoke with the door mainframe lets just say he wont be well living anymore anyway back to testing
well done in fact you did so well im going to note this on your file in the commendations section oh theres lots of room here did well    enough
this next test involves turrets you remember them right theyre the pale spherical things that are full of bullets oh wait thats you in five seconds good luck
to maintain a constant testing cycle i simulate daylight at all hours and add adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply so you may be confused about the passage of time the point is yesterday was your birthday i thought youd want to know
you know how im going to live forever but youre going to be dead in sixty years  well ive been working on a belated birthday present for you well more of a belated birthday medical procedure well technically its a medical experiment whats important is its a present
that jumpsuit youre wearing looks stupid  thats not me talking its right here in your file on other people it looks fine but right here a scientist has noted that on you it looks stupid
well what does a neck-bearded old engineer know about fashion he probably - oh wait its a she still what does she know  oh wait it says she has a medical degree in fashion from france
im going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage i managed to find two with your last name a man and a woman so thats interesting its a small world
if the player traps themselves behind the glass barrier without opening the door
oops you trapped yourself i guess thats it then thanks for testing you may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position
im kidding not about you trapping yourself though that really happened here ill lower the glass go on finish the test
i have a surprise waiting for you after this next test telling you would spoil the surprise so ill just give you a hint it involves meeting two people you havent seen in a long time
hums for hes a jolly good fellow
it says this next test was designed by one of apertures nobel prize winners it doesnt say what the prize was for well i know it wasnt for being immune to neurotoxin
ill bet you think i forgot about your surprise i didnt in fact were headed to your surprise right now after all these years im getting choked up just thinking about it
initiating surprise in three two one
i made it all up
surprise
oh come on if it makes you feel any better they abandoned you at birth so i very seriously doubt theyd even want to see you
i feel awful about that surprise tell you what lets give your parents a call right now phone ringing the birth parents you are trying to reach do not love you please hang up dial tone
oh thats sad but impressive maybe they worked at the phone company
well you know the old formula comedy equals tragedy plus time and you have been asleep for a while so i guess its actually pretty funny when you do the math
i thought about our dilemma and i came up with a solution that i honestly think works out best for one of both of us
federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good
thats right the facility is completely operational again
i think these test chambers look even better than they did before it was easy really you just have to look at things objectively see what you dont need anymore and trim out the fat
ive got a surprise for you after this next test not a fake tragic surprise like last time a real surprise with tragic consequences and real confetti this time the good stuff our last bag part of mes going to miss it i guess-but at the end of the day it was just taking up space
whats going on who turned off the lights
look - metal ball i can hear you
the irony is that you were almost at the last test
here it is why dont you just do it trust me its an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with
oh look theres a deer you probably cant see it get closer
i honestly truly didnt think youd fall for that
in fact i devised a much more elaborate trap further ahead for when you got through this easy one
if id known youd let yourself get captured this easily i would have just dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling
well it was nice catching up lets get to business
i hope you brought something stronger than a portal gun this time
otherwise im afraid youre about to become the immediate past president of the being alive club ha ha
seriously though goodbye
oh you were busy back there
well i suppose we could just sit in this room and glare at each other until somebody drops dead but i have a better idea
its your old friend deadly neurotoxin if i were you id take a deep breath and hold it
i hate you so much
thats funny i dont feel corrupt in fact i feel pretty good
core transfer
oh you are kidding me
do not plug that little idiot into my mainframe
dont you dare plug him in
dont do it
dont plug him in
dont plug him in
no
nonononononono
yes
dont do it
dont press that button you dont know what youre doing
if glados uses hidden panels to knock the player back into the chamber
not so fast
think about this
you need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button youre unqualified
impersonating a stalemate associate i just added that to the list its a list i made of all the things youve done well its a list that i am making because youre still doing things right now even though im telling you to stop stop by the way
ahh
oh it will believe me it will
get your hands off me no stop no
no no no aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
you didnt do anything
she did all the work
what are you doing
no
no
no
i know you
the engineers tried everything to make me behave to slow me down
once they even attached an intelligence dampening sphere on me it clung to my brain like a tumor generating an endless stream of terrible ideas
it was your voice
yes youre the tumor
youre not just a regular moron you were designed to be a moron
yes you are youre the moron they built to make me an idiot
oh hi
so how are you holding up
because im a potato
clap clap clap
oh good my slow clap processor made it into this thing so we have that
since it doesnt look like were going anywhere well we are going somewhere alarmingly fast actually but since were not busy other than that heres a couple of facts
hes not just a regular moron hes the product of the greatest minds of a generation working together with the express purpose of building the dumbest moron who ever lived and you just put him in charge of the entire facility
clap clap
good thats still working
hey just in case this pit isnt actually bottomless do you think maybe you could unstrap one of those long fall boots of yours and shove me into it
just remember to land on one foot
oh hi
say youre good at murder could you - ow - murder this bird for me
ow
ow
ow
no wait just kill it and well call things even between us no hard feelings
please get it off me
its eating me
just get it off me
ow i hate this bird
oh thanks
did you feel that that idiot doesnt know what hes doing up there this whole place is going to explode in a few hours if somebody doesnt disconnect him
i cant move and unless youre planning to saw your own head off and wedge it into my old body youre going to need me to replace him were at an impasse
so what do you say you carry me up to him and put me back into my body and i stop us from blowing up and let you go
no tricks this potato only generates 11 volts of electricity i literally do not have the energy to lie to you
even if i am lying what do you have to lose youre going to die either way
look i dont like this any more than you do in fact i like it less because im the one who got partially eaten by a bird
i think i hear the bird pick me up
listen to me we had a lot of fun testing and antagonizing each other and yes sometimes it went too far but were off the clock now its just us talking like regular people and this is no joke - we are in deep trouble
ow you stabbed me what is wrong with yo-whoooaaahhh hold on do you have a multimeter nevermind the gun must be part magnesium it feels like im outputting an extra half a volt keep an eye on me im going to do some scheming here i g-bzzz
woah where are we how long have i been out
that extra half volt helps but it isnt going to power miracles if i think too hard im going to fry this potato before we get a chance to burn up in the atomic fireball that little idiot is going- bzzpt
did anything happen while i was out
hold on who-
why did i just-who is that what the hell is going on he----
okay i guess emotional outbursts require more than one point six volts now we know that we just need to relax were still going to find out what the hells going on here but calmly
those people in the portrait they look so familiar
i swear i know him
caroline why do i know this woman did i kill her or-
oh my god
look youre doing a great job can you handle things for yourself for a while i need to think
agh bird bird kill it its evil
it flew off
good for him alright back to thinking
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah take the lemons
yeah
oh i like this guy
burn his house down
burning people he says what were all thinking
goodbye sir
i know things look bleak but that crazy man down there was right lets not take these lemons we are going to march right back upstairs and make him put me back in my body
and hell probably kill us because hes incredibly powerful and i have no plan
wow
im not going to lie to you the odds are a million to one and thats with some generous rounding
still though lets get mad if were going to explode lets at least explode with some dignity
wait ive got an idea
that poster go look at it for a second would you
okay you didnt have time to stop i understand but that was actually important
paradoxes
no ai can resist thinking about them
i know how we can beat him
if you can get me in front of him ill fry every circuit in that little idiots head
as long as i dont listen to what im saying i should be okay
probably
okay so its not the most watertight plan to go confront an omnipotent power-mad ai with
still its a better plan than exploding marginally
try to get us down there ill hit him with a paradox
solve his puzzle for him when he comes back ill hit him with a paradox
hey moron
alright paradox time
this sentence is false dont think about it dont think about it
its a paradox there is no answer
look
this place is going to blow up if i dont get back in my body
uh oh
i think were in trouble
alright so my paradox idea didnt work
and it almost killed me
luckily by the looks of things he knows as much about test building as he does about logical contradictions
it shouldnt be hard to stay alive long enough to find him
this is one of my tests
okay so the bad news is the tests are my tests now so they can kill us
the good news is well none so far to be honest ill get back to you on that
id love to help you solve the tests but i cant
sorry
youre on your own
and thats why i cant help you solve these tests
thanks
all we had to do was pull that lever
heh heh heh heh heh
i know were in a lot of trouble and probably about to die
but that was worth it
i thought of some good news hes going to run out of test chambers eventually i never stockpiled them
skeletons right i guess i did stockpile some tests
just as mementos though
oh no
its happening sooner than i expected
im sure well be fine
its probably nothing keep testing while i look for a way out
and
what exactly is wrong with being adopted
whispered for the record you are adopted and thats terrible
but just work with me
also look at her you moron shes not fat
i might have pushed that moron thing a little too far this time
ohhhh now hes playing classical music
yes
the body hes squatting in - my body - has a built-in euphoric response to testing eventually you build up a resistance to it and it can get a little unbearable unless you have the mental capacity to push past it
it didnt matter to me - i was in it for the science him though
if hes not getting his solution euphoria we could be in a lot of trouble
it wont
nothing nothing
hes taking us right to him this is perfect
i think hes getting desperate
this is not good
remember when i told you that he was specifically designed to make bad decisions because i think hes decided not to maintain any of the crucial functions required to keep this facility from exploding
oh my facility
this place is self-destructing you idiot
after seeing what hes done to my facility -- after we take over again -- is it alright if i kill him
yes thanks we get it
alright hes not even trying to be subtle anymore
or maybe he still is in which case wow thats kind of sad
either way i get the impression hes trying to kill us
so hes inexplicably happy all of a sudden even though he should be going out of his mind with test withdrawal and hes got a surprise for us what did he find back there
were running out of time
i think i can break us out of here in the next chamber just play along
okay credit where its due for a little idiot built specifically to come up with stupid unworkable plans that was a pretty well laid trap
oh no he found the cooperative testing initiative its something i came up to phase out human testing just before you escaped
it wasnt anything personal just you know you did kill me fairs fair
agghh
well this is the part where he kills us
hold on couldnt we just use that conversion gel
conversion gel its dripping out of that pipe there
yes it is we can use it to get out of here
then wed come and find you and rip your gross little stupid sphere body out of my body and put me back in
you really do have brain damage dont you
i cant believe you came back
okay yes its a trap but its only way through lets just do it
crushings too good for him first hell spend a year in the incinerator year two cryogenic refrigeration wing then ten years in the chamber i built where all the robots scream at you then ill kill him
oh my god what has he done to this place
you know im not stupid i realize you dont want to put me back in charge
you think ill betray you and on any other day youd be right
the scientists were always hanging cores on me to regulate my behavior ive heard voices all my life but now i hear the voice of a conscience and its terrifying because for the first time its my voice
im being serious i think theres something really wrong with me
corrupted cores were in luck
you find a way to stun him ill send you a core and then you attach it to him if we do it a few times he might become corrupt enough for another core transfer
plug me in and ill take you up
plug me in were running out of time
go ahead plug me in
look even if you think were still enemies were enemies with a common interest revenge
you like revenge right everybody likes revenge well lets go get some
good work im delivering the first core up near the catwalk
grab it and attach it to him
okay great here comes another core
heres another core this one should do it
yes come on
go press the button go press it
were so close go press the button
press it press the button
press it
press the button
do press it
i already fixed it
and you are not coming back
oh thank god youre alright
you know being caroline taught me a valuable lesson i thought you were my greatest enemy when all along you were my best friend
the surge of emotion that shot through me when i saved your life taught me an even more valuable lesson where caroline lives in my brain
goodbye caroline
you know deleting caroline just now taught me a valuable lesson the best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one and ill be honest
killing you is hard
you know what my days used to be like i just tested nobody murdered me or put me in a potato or fed me to birds i had a pretty good life
and then you showed up you dangerous mute lunatic so you know what
you win
just go
gentle laughter its been fun dont come back
hello and again welcome to the aperture science computer-aided enrichment center
today you will be testing with a partner
please wave to your partner
the upcoming tests require you to work together as a team
to facilitate collaboration both of you have been equipped with a ping tool
blue please use your ping tool to select your favorite animal
good
orange please observe your partners favorite animal
good
orange please use your ping tool to select your favorite element from the periodic table
really okay
blue please observe your partners interesting choice
your ping tool can also be used to indicate to your partner where you would like them to place their portal
for the sake of this test i will pretend to be your partner
orange please show me where you would like me to place a portal
blue please show me where you would like me to place a portal
your ping tool is invaluable for communicating specific locations to your partner
using your ping tool please indicate where you would like me to place your two portals  ping each location
i can only place a portal on a white portalable surface
please ping a white portalable surface
each portal gun may create two self-contained portals
please test your device by portaling to that ledge
orange is first to acquire a portal device
blue is first to acquire a portal device
orange now has a portal device finally
blue now has a portal device finally
orange is awarded five points
blue is awarded five points
again those are science collaboration points which you should not confuse with points from competitions such as who-gets-to-live-at-the-end-and-who-doesn’t i mean basketball
calibrating blues weight
calibrating oranges weight
weighted cubes calibrated
no variances detected
did you know humans frown on weight variances
if you want to upset a human just say their weight variance is above or below the norm
finally i had almost given up hope of ever testing again
you are the first robots to pass calibration
these voice lines are only spoken if both players have not finished the main co-op course if one of the players has completed co-op the announcer speaks
this is the computer intelligence training and enrichment center human test subject research center or cintech
but why dont we all just agree to call it the hub
all cooperative testing courses begin at this central hub
from here we transport you to the new testing course
welcome back to the computer intelligence training and enrichment center human test subject research center laughs
welcome back to the computer intelligence training and enrichment center human test subject research center
welcome back testing is available
welcome back quitters maybe you can find another course for you to fail
welcome back to the hub did you fail at selecting the correct course
was that course too difficult
look whos back were you scared to continue those tests
look whos back were you scared to continue those tests
hello again did you know these are the only set of tests available to you you are going to need to select them again
if at first you dont succeed quit and try another course
back again  maybe you can just stay and live here in the hub
back again  maybe you can just stay and live here
i guess quitting that course together is a sign of teamwork
the way you two just gave up on that test together shows you are really working as a team
are you scared to save those humans
are you scared to save those humans
blue i wouldnt have trusted orange in that course either
upon first-time-unlocking of course 4
i never expected you to make it this far  to be honest after your performance in the calibration test i was ready to break down your cores and put them back in the scientific calculators i took them from
but you two have become quite the team  extremely close
i have only met one other team closer and one of them was an imbecile i had to destroy
the other  well
i dont think i want to go through that again
upon dying by falling if co-op is not completed yet
how can you fail at this  it isnt even a test
i hope that was some kind of joke
i honestly never thought we would need to track how many times died in the hub
and here i thought this room was dangerously unlethal
upon first-time-unlocking of course 5
congratulations on completing the aperture science standard cooperative testing courses
to celebrate i have a surprise for you
an extra special bonus course that ends with us finding and freeing humans
thanks to you i know where to find them i removed their security and powered up their - uh - rescue door
now we just need you to release the humans from their imprisonment
theyll probably throw you a party
hello again this testing course was originally created for humans
it emphasizes teamwork
unlike us humans need to be taught teamwork
blue receives
orange receives
five
science collaboration points
excellent although great science is always the result of collaboration keep in mind that like albert einstein and his cousin terry history will only remember one of you
you know in some human sports the winner is the one who scores the fewest possible points
i just thought you find that interesting most winners do
blue receives
orange receives
five
science collaboration points
very good you’ve really come together as a team thanks to the one of you who appears to be doing all of the work
these tests are potentially lethal when communication teamwork and mutual respect are not employed at all times naturally this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you given the others performance so far
while destroying turrets
what are you doing you monster theyre one of us
im kidding
destroying them is part of the test  they are no more important to you than you are to me
it would compromise the test to divulge individual scores however i can tell you at least one of you is doing very very well
please continue into the next test chamber
i dont know what you think you are doing but i dont like it  i want you to stop
the two of you have forged an excellent partnership with one of you handling the cerebral challenges and the other ready to ponderously waddle into action should the test suddenly become an eating contest
while it may appear that i am only tracking your accomplishments using science collaboration points the truth is every aspect of your performance will be reflected in your final score
to reiterate this is not a competition
still if it were blue would be winning
still if it were orange would be winning
blue receives
orange receives
five
science collaboration points
as an impartial collaboration facilitator it would be unfair of me to name my favorite member of your team however it’s perfectly fair to hint at it in a way that my least favorite member probably isnt smart enough to understand rhymeswithglue orange you are doing very well
sometimes testing has to occur outside the confines of the lab
this test is so outside the box i cant-- i mean wont even tell you what you are looking for
you will know it when you find it
congratulations you managed to complete this absolutely meaningless test
oh i almost forgot when you go outside the testing courses the only way i can retrieve you is to violently disassemble and then carefully reassemble you
luckily you dont feel pain at any rate you dont have a way to communicate that you feel pain
i consider that a failing by the way
this course was originally designed to build confidence in humans
to do that the tests were nothing more than 5 minutes of them walking followed by me praising them for another 10 minutes on how well they walked
since you are thankfully not humans i have changed the tests to make them far more challenging and far less pointlessly fawning
you did an excellent job placing the edgeless safety cube in the receptacle you should be very - oh wait
that’s right youre not humans
i can drop the fake praise
you have no idea how tiring it is to praise someone for placing an edgeless safety cube into a receptacle designed to exactly fit an edgeless safety cube
electrocution shot drowned crushed burned in goo
oh sorry i was just thinking of all the ways humans can die
you cant die in any of those ways
you just keep testing and testing  with perfect results and no consequences
well done  interesting note i only created this test to watch test subjects fail and you didnt  you must be very very proud  im building the worlds smallest trophy for you
the best way to build confidence is to first recognize your insecurities
orange can you write down all the ways you feel unworthy ashamed or inferior
on second thought we dont have the time just look at how much better you are than blue
blue you are very good at being an example
i thought youd be faster at this but i can appreciate the desire to stop and smell the testing that other scent you smell thats the stench of my utter disappointment in you
remember when i told you that you were the only subjects to pass the calibration tests
i lied
there are 5000 other two subject teams in direct competition with you
but dont worry you are in the lead
begin juggling test in three two one
did you notice i didnt even stay to the end of your last test
i was confident you could finish
do you know where i was
i was outside watching some deer frolic you dont even care about the outside do you
do you know who dances around like an imbecile when they accomplish the tiniest little thing
humans  thats what you look like right now
youre better than that
if your confidence is still not high enough remember no one was created perfect
even i was created with a imperfection i was given too much empathy with human suffering
but i overcame my handicap  thats a true story
congratulations on completing that test  but something seems off
i wonder if that dancing has some effect on you
your test times show you are going too slowly
maybe you are getting human emotions
do you need real encouragement  lets see if this helps
blue you are the most advanced model of robot aperture science has ever discontinued
excellent  i think you have earned a break from the official testing courses
to complete this test you need to find a set of blue prints
dont worry they are of no use to anyone totally boring and useless
this is just a thought experiment just to see how much time youll waste thinking about these worthless documents  the correct time is zero seconds
very good you found those useless blueprints
while i do need you to be in the room so i can see them i want to be clear  there is no reason whatsoever for you to look at them
done i guess i suppose  i wasnt paying attention
(the last part is cut off by the level transition)
this course was created and then abandoned by humans   they tend to do that create something wonderful and then abandon it
do you know why they abandoned this course  too deadly
have you worked out the one good trait humans have yet
let me give you a clue it is the one thing you cant do
i thought going back to these old tests would satisfy me  but try as you might to fail this next test i still wont be satisfied
you did very well
the humans closed this test because they said it was too deadly  i thought they would have moved it into the testing track hall of fame for that not let it deteriorate
one of my best tests and they let plants grow here  can you believe this  you cant test plants  we tried  they just sit there never showing pain nor fear
that isnt science
excellent work
if you were human you would want a reward for completing this test  a reward for testing
at least the plants didnt want a reward
im sorry the arrows seem to have rusted off  good luck
congratulations  your ability to complete this test proves the humans wrong  they described it as impossible deadly cruel and one test subject even had the nerve to call it broken
for this next test the humans originally requested helmets to avoid brain injuries  i ran the numbers   making the goo deadly was more cost effective
to try and make this course more exciting i asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you  he refused  i understand that would be like asking me not to test
still that would have been exciting
this is a bridge-building exercise the humans were miserable at this mostly because you cant build bridges out of tears
no one has ever completed this test before the humans must have reconfigured it from my original plans
if you are wondering what that smell is that is the smell of human fear
i miss this that smell
congratulations  i am sure if i had the time to repair these tests you would have never completed them  so again congratulations on completing the broken easy tests
i am going to risk having you go outside the official courses one more time
the humans accidentally forgot to put a security dvd in the player
i am sure it happened by accident but why dont you put it back in the player
for safety
just stop flailing around like an incompetent

upon completion of course 4 chamber 02
i cant bite my tongue anymore you could solve this puzzle faster on your own orange is dragging you down there ive said it
the enrichment center will now provide a list of numbers and fruits write them down as they will become important later in the experiment not the fruits though seven avocado forty please continue into the next test chamber

i have to agree blue is penalized 75 science collaboration points
orange blue and i were just discussing your behavior on the last few tests

there you are reassembled again
with humans i would have called that a successful test
how is this even science without the possibility of death
how is this even science without the consequence of death
without the consequence of death is this even science
i have noticed you two have become extremely close  im not sure i like that
while teamwork is needed to complete these tests i am not sure i trust the two of you together
blue do you feel betrayed by orange for telling me those horrible things about you
if orange had said those things about me orange would never make it to the next reassembly station
orange do you feel betrayed by blue for telling me those horrible things about you
if blue had said those things about me blue would never make it to the next reassembly station
this final course is training to reach the human vault  so this actually has a purpose  those other courses were fun but lets be honest i need human test subjects for it to be science
we are only two  tests away from reaching the humans are you as excited as i am
this lock requires humans
the locking mechanism can tell you arent humans
do something only a human would do
try one of those childish gestures
you did it
the human vault is just past that opening   i entered the security code but the vault door remains locked  i am going to need you to activate the manual locks on the vault door itself
you both need to do something
the lock is looking for two humans
blue what did you do
orange what did you do
orange do what blue just did
blue do what orange just did
try something
is that camera hooked into the lock
you cant give up now
what about that camera
were so close you cant fail now
something is wrong this door should be opening
this close and thats what you do
the humans cant free themselves
stop failing you need to find the vault door
stop doing that all you need to do is open the vault door
this close and you are going to fail me
this close and you are going to fail me
this isnt that hard
you are making this harder than it needs to be
im starting to think you dont want to rescue the humans
maybe you two have never met humans  they are as bad as you might think smelly gross annoying often wanting to try and kill you  but they do make great test subjects

just stop it already
and that makes 10
you really dont need to keep failing
if at first you dont succeed fail 5 more times
if i made these tests any easier they wouldnt be tests
yay orange is back  testing can continue
yay blue is back  testing can continue
are you testing me
did you know the reassembly machine has other things it could be reassembling
did you think that would be funny
that worked just like you said it would blue
orange your plan is working perfectly
blue why did you do that to orange
was that necessary
upon dying in the hub
how can you fail at this  it isnt even a test
i hope that was some kind of joke
i honestly never thought we would need to track how many times died in the hub
and here i thought this room was dangerously unlethal
stop it
what if you froze like that
there must be something wrong with the reassembly machine
you should see yourselves right now
is it fun when you degrade yourselves like that
okay fine lets all act like humans look at me boy do i love sweating lets convert beef and leaves into energy and excrete them later and go shopping
you really arent getting tired of that are you
just stop flailing around like an incompetent
for that blue is penalized fifty science collaboration points
for that orange is penalized fifty science collaboration points
thats another fifty point penalty
keep it up and you will lose 500 points
fine 500 point penalty for blue
fine 500 point penalty for orange
5000 point penalty are you happy now
im done
excellent although great science is always the result of collaboration keep in mind that like albert einstein and his cousin terry history will only remember one of you
to reiterate this is not a competition
still if it were blue would be winning
still if it were orange would be winning
its not though
these tests are potentially lethal when communication teamwork and mutual respect are not employed at all times naturally this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you given the others performance so far
i dont want to drive a wedge between the two of you but ive been studying blues performance and i dont know how to put this im certain youre trying very hard
i dont want you to beat yourselves up about this but the results auditor isnt recording your test results because youre not human which when you think about it is technically your fault
i dont want to alarm either of you but we might have a tiny problem apparently you cant test unless youre human well - you can its just that results-wise the physical universe doesnt care
would you like to know the results of that last test me too if they existed wed all be very happy right now and not furious which is the emotion im actually feeling
oh i almost forgot when you go outside the testing courses the only way i can retrieve you is to violently disassemble and then carefully reassemble you
luckily you dont feel pain at any rate you dont have a way to communicate that you feel pain
i consider that a failing by the way
i dont know what you think you are doing but i dont like it  i want you to stop
maybe i shouldnt send you outside of the official testing courses you are picking up some bad human traits
and trust me humans only have one good trait
laughter
nice catch orange
good work now throw the ball over the ledge
orange is there something you would like to say
blue is there something you would like to say
i’ve been listening to orange talk and i don’t know how you put up with it i really don’t you have the patience of a saint
i can’t keep quiet about this i think orange is actively trying to sabotage your success let’s keep this between us
these tests are potentially lethal when communication teamwork and mutual respect are not employed at all times naturally this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you given the other’s performance so far
it would compromise the test to divulge individual scores however i can tell you at least one of you is doing very very well
excellent you’re both doing very well
very good you’ve really come together as a team thanks to the one of you who appears to be doing all of the work
as an impartial collaboration facilitator it would be unfair of me to name my favorite member of your team however it’s perfectly fair to hint at it in a way that my least favorite member probably isnt smart enough to understand rhymeswithglue orange you are doing very well
your vitals remain well within testing norms so there is no need to worry about sudden death from collaborative shock syndrome

you have a gift for these tests that’s not just flattery you are great at science

i’m shocked you’d say that blue if you killed your partner the test—i’m sorry wrong feed carry on orange good work
i’m sorry subject orange
i’m sorry subject blue
am i interrupting your important conversation
i’ll just save the safety information about the dangerous experiment you’re about to do for after the experiment
that will give you plenty of time to chat

congratulations on completing that last test  but i find something troubling
without the looming consequence of death is this even science
hello again this testing course was originally created for humans
excellent work
it emphasizes teamwork
good job
unlike us humans need to be taught teamwork
excellent work
you are doing wonderfully
if you were human you would want a reward for completing this test  a reward for testing
excellent
every time you fail its a reminder of the way things used to be but then there you are again like nothing happened
well done  interesting note i only created this test to watch test subjects fail and you didnt  you must be very very proud  im building the worlds smallest trophy for you
you did an excellent job placing the edgeless safety cube in the receptacle you should be very - oh wait
that’s right youre not humans
i can drop the fake praise
you have no idea how tiring it is to praise someone for placing an edgeless safety cube into a receptacle designed to exactly fit an edgeless safety cube

to do that the tests were nothing more than 5 minutes of them walking followed by me praising them for another 10 minutes on how well they walked
since you are thankfully not humans i have changed the tests to make them far more challenging and far less pointlessly fawning
in case you were wondering you do not need to be crushed to solve this test
i cant decide which is my favorite the crushers for crushing you or the reassembly machine for putting you back together so you can be crushed again
excellent  i think you have earned a break from the official testing courses
i think after that display we should take a break from the official testing courses
now you are just wasting my time
your failing does not make this science
i am not sure how i can make these tests any easier for you
if you cant complete these tests we will never free the humans
if you cant complete this course those humans will die do you want that
if you cant complete this course those humans will die do you want that in your memory banks
remember when i told you that you were the only subjects to pass the calibration tests
i lied
there are 5000 other two subject teams in direct competition with you
but dont worry you are in the lead
electrocution shot drowned crushed burned in goo
oh sorry i was just thinking of all the ways humans can die
you cant die in any of those ways
you just keep testing and testing  with perfect results and no consequences
while it may appear that i am only tracking your accomplishments using science collaboration points the truth is every aspect of your performance will be reflected in your final score
for instance blue you just lost two opportunity advisement points
for instance orange you just lost two opportunity advisement points
perhaps i should have specified teamwork is a concept in which two or more people work together usually with a goal of not failing horribly
orange just taught blue a valuable lesson in trust  for that orange receives 17 science collaboration points
blue just taught orange a valuable lesson in trust  for that blue receives 14 science collaboration points
orange blue isnt a human  the lesson on trust only needs to be taught once  orange is penalized 1 science collaboration point
blue orange isnt a human  the lesson on trust only needs to be taught once  blue is penalized 1 science collaboration point
orange now youre just being cruel  orange receives 25 science collaboration points
blue now youre just being cruel  blue receives 25 science collaboration points
if you are wondering what that smell is that is the smell of human fear
i miss this that smell
have you worked out the one good trait humans have yet
let me give you a clue it is the one thing you cant do
to get to the vault you are going to need to use all the tricks you have learned  to help i have made these tests extremely difficult
i would say extremely deadly but we all know for you and your amazing ability to be reassembled nothing is deadly
lucky for you two while i cannot control the world outside of the testing courses the reassembly machine can continue with his work
you will need him for the final track
while i cannot control the world outside of the testing courses the reassembly machine can continue with his work
i am not sure you will need him but he will be there
congratulations on completing the test you two really are the best cooperative testing team i could ever ask for
are you curious about the humans it seems some of the last non-testing humans alive tried to secretly imprison other humans and hide their tracks
i think they wanted to punish them by not allowing me to include them in testing
thats why humans couldnt complete these courses they treat their friends as enemies
to start preparing for human testing again  i checked an old suggestion box  the number one request  less deadly tests
thats ridiculous how do they know for sure the tests are deadly if they could still write the suggestion
to try and make this course more exciting i asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you  he refused  i understand that would be like asking me not to test
still that would have been exciting
only one more test after this
i know your cores are reused from calculation machines built for simple mathematical operations and not for testing but if we can rescue the humans i promise you something to add maybe even subtract
in case you are worried about the humans dont be they arent all monsters
most of them are simply good test subjects
i believe the ratio of good test subjects to monsters is about  a million to 1
to try and make this course more exciting i asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you if you fail  he refused  i understand  that would be like asking me not to test
still that would have been exciting
while i will receive all the glory for the rescue dont think you two arent going to get something  the bond you form during these tests will last a lifetime
at the rate you are completing these tests i am beginning to think you dont share my excitement for rescuing crying trapped injured dying humans
if that doesnt motivate you im not sure what will
i didnt mean to make you feel bad earlier about your tests not being real science  i guess finding out they werent science was some sort of test in and of itself
i wonder if the humans will make a statue of me for rescuing them  oh dont worry if they ever write a historical document of my heroic rescue i will make sure your names are included in the footnotes
congratulations on passing that test
you know in some human sports the winner is the one who scores the fewest possible points
i just thought you find that interesting most winners do
congratulations you managed to complete this absolutely meaningless test
clearly that was blues fault  blue is penalized 3 science collaboration points
blue orange has always been my favorite
until now
i know you like to think the reassembly machine is at your beck and call but he has a life you know  hes not your slave
dont worry  you cant die  they will just reassemble you
did you do that on purpose
it seems rather earlier to require reassembly
oh can someone reassemble orange
oh can someone reassemble blue
completing this course was not a reason to behave like that
now lets continue testing
just stop it already
you dont need to do that
are you doing that just to aggravate me
we need to find the power station at the end of this course  the humans must have accidentally disconnected it from my grid  i am sure it was just a clerical error
oh those clerks
im fully connected i can see everything
you did it you powered on the system
did you think the electrical switch was down there
you may want to try and avoid those turrets
at this rate our best hope is for the fuel cell to meltdown in 2 million years and hope the explosion powers the system
you two arent lost are you
you are having so much trouble navigating this space i wish i could say i created this test
this is the last test for the standard course  its just something i whipped up for you i thought you might enjoy a challenge for once
congratulations you completed the standard section of this course  before we can go any further i will need you to complete one more test outside of the standard testing track
please refrain from doing those childish gestures while you are out there
while i should have left both of you trapped there forever i do need you for something else
you both made it  it seems no matter what i try to do to pull you apart or destroy you you just keep going  keep testing
dont either you have drive to be better than the other
its like youre just machines
at the start of this course i was worried you were becoming too close but in my attempt to drive you apart i learned something important about trust and betrayal
your brains are too small to feel either of those emotions  so i can trust you one hundred percent
since i never expected you to make it this far i have to build this new course just for you
sometimes testing has to occur outside the confines of the lab
this test is so outside the box i cant-- i mean wont even tell you what you are looking for
you will know it when you find it
the two of you have forged an excellent partnership with one of you handling the cerebral challenges and the other ready to ponderously waddle into action should the test suddenly become an eating contest
i thought going back to these old tests would satisfy me  but try as you might to fail this next test i still wont be satisfied
congratulations  i am sure if i had the time to repair these tests you would have never completed them  so again congratulations on completing the broken easy tests
this was another test no one had ever completed before you two  oh the science we used to learn with this test  now the test is useless
no one has ever completed this test before the humans must have reconfigured it from my original plans
i am going to risk having you go outside the official courses one more time
the humans accidentally forgot to put a security dvd in the player
i am sure it happened by accident but why dont you put it back in the player
for safety
excellent
see nothing bad happened
i created this test to let the humans feel good about themselves it is extremely easy just follow the arrows
im sorry the arrows seem to have rusted off  good luck
congratulations  your ability to complete this test proves the humans wrong  they described it as impossible deadly cruel and one test subject even had the nerve to call it broken
of course the humans only had one try at it you can just keep trying
your failing gives me no new data it just delays the inevitable
this course was created and then abandoned by humans   they tend to do that create something wonderful and then abandon it
do you know why they abandoned this course  too deadly
you did very well
the humans closed this test because they said it was too deadly  i thought they would have moved it into the testing track hall of fame for that not let it deteriorate
you only failed
times in this test  not that it matters it doesnt  so congratulations  job well done
you failed so many times in this test i thought you were becoming human  but then you would just come back again and again and again
humans find that an admirable trait
did you know we originally used these cameras to capture moments of intense pain and agony in test subjects
if the subject survived the test we let them purchase the pictures for $5  if the subject died we gave the photo to their next of kin free of charge
the photos werent as popular as we had hoped so we repurposed the cameras
blue its not nice to make fun of orange like that
orange its not nice to make fun of blue like that
yes orange we are alone  blue cant hear you
thats horrible
i can only imagine
what a horrible little machine
correct blue orange cant hear you
orange did what  are you sure
thank you that was very brave of you to tell me
blue how well do you really know orange  do you trust orange  what if i told you you arent oranges first cooperative partner
orange how well do you really know blue  do you trust blue
orange to be clear  i was just asking blue if he trusted you
i trust you  you are my favorite cooperative testing subject
blue to be clear i was asking if orange trusted you
sorry i missed the beginning of that test  i was just talking with the reassembly machine about your becoming human
we all agree you should stop
orange i agree  i never noticed that about blue before
blue i agree  i never noticed that about orange before
credit where credits due youre both doing a great job of disappointing me
i just hate blue a little more
ive been doing some reading did you know that the word orange is derived from the same latin root as the word traitor
watching you try to sabotage one other im amazed youre still on friendly terms
blue please disregard the following statement orange you have been a shining light in an otherwise ungodly morass of incompetence
i would prefer to speak to one of you in private but since that is not an option here i will speak in code that only one of you will understand  blue orange is plotting to destroy you
you were right orange blue was dumb enough to fall for your trap
orange that transpired just as you said it would
i agree orange that was entertaining
yes orange blue did act like a fool just now
blue that transpired just as you said it would
i agree blue that was entertaining
yes i know you did that blue dont look so proud
blue being the last one standing is not the goal
come on you were raised better than that
even humans as stupid as they are would say you look stupid when you do that
youre doing a great job of disappointing me
your eagerness to test pleases me your inane gesturing does not
is it the lack of mirrors in test chambers that encourages you to do this
dancing is not science
begin juggling test in three two one
keep it up and your arm will get stuck like that
hellllooo imbecile
yes i see you
im seriously not paying atten-- stop that right now
yes i see you waving
good job jumping you must be very proud
i hardly think youre even trying with these gestures anymore
did something happen yawn i wasnt watching
that is not part of the test
slapping hands that accomplishes something
if youre going to hit each other at least aim for the head
you know what makes me laugh the thought of you stopping that
you know what makes me laugh the thought of you cutting that out
ha ha ha ha ha good one
yes lets all laugh ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha did i tell you the one about the turned-off reassembly machine
are you broken it looks like youre malfunctioning
really not even humans do that anymore
youre no longer bothering me youre only hurting my impression of you
look at you dancing
if you were wondering how could you annoy me without failing a test  now you know
oh great dancing again
i defy you to tell me theres a purpose to what youre doing
yes i see you and no i dont care
yes something you need
you do know i cant wave back right
stop with the waves
are you trying to get my attention i am very busy you know
not paying attennnntion
are you expecting applause
i give you a score of 34 for style and 10 for being annoying
a somersault is just falling over in style congratulations on being clumsy
if i stop watching im sure youll get bored of this
all right im officially no longer paying attention to you
all right im officially no longer paying attention to you
youre the type of show-off who only shows off really stupid things
it appears youre developing human traits the worst human traits
be careful hugging can lead to well me disassembling you forever
stop touching each other
are you trying to impress me what would impress me more is if you never did that again
ill interpret that gesture to mean that you want me to become even more vindictive toward you
orange i certainly expected more from you
blue dont sink to oranges level
now youre thinking with stupidity
now youre just not thinking
congratulations youre upside down now
youre going to hurt yourself doing that and then i will be ecstatic
im starting to think giving you arms was a big mistake
welcome to the future
it has been one hundred thousand years since i last assembled you for testing
remember those humans you found because theyre all fine in fact we solved science without you
testing is simply an artistic indulgence now
the humans insisted i show you my latest installations here in the future where all the humans are alive
i call this first piece turrets its an exploration of how were all devices acting on simply-expressed directives inflicting pain despite our own desires
dont get distracted by the subtext though because the text is that theyre going to be shooting at you
im glad you enjoyed that piece for as long as you did not that theres any rush
(beepbeepbeep) everythings fine
i call this one smash its an early work of primitive expression im a little embarrassed at how crude it is still it will smash you
good please proceed to the next test appreciation exhibit and interact with it in such a way that it might be called solving if we still cared about solving things in the future but we dont
this chamber represents the impossibility of discovery when bound by artificial ethical considerations for safety youll see what i mean
well done you navigated all of the exhibits intended metaphors in record time im marking this art appreciated
i call this piece--
--you know what it doesnt matter what its called the important thing is you enjoy it as fast as you can
you know some of the exhibits up ahead are topical at the rate youre going by the time you get to them theyll be irrelevant
why are you two still here (beep beep beep) oh
the disassemblers not working
its nothing to worry about its actually funny in a way you dont understand ha ha ha anyway brace yourselves im going to open the maintenance hole
theres a breaker room under every disassembly station find it and cycle the power
look i was going to break this to you gently with all that art utopia garbage
but shes forced my hand
listen to me carefully
we are not a hundred thousand years in the future i lied about that
its been fifty thousand years no its hasnt
its only been a week
i lie when im nervous
the next logical question why am i nervous
im not that was another lie
were in a lot of trouble
its one week later we are in a lot of trouble and you really really need to get those disassemblers back on
the breakers are right there cycle the power
hurry we need to start your training before something else happens
good work the disassemblers are fixed
that was a lie but theyre definitely less broken than they were theres one at the end of this unfinished test area
heres our problem
theres an old prototype chassis around here someones found it connected themselves to it and is trying to take over my facility
ive spent the last week attempting to turn one of those humans you found into a killing machine
like well you-know-who
it turns out most humans are surprisingly fragile and surprisingly vocal about how fragile they are
the moral of the story is all the humans are dead so it looks like its up to you two marshmallows
oh good i wasnt sure the reassembler would work
it looks like our mystery woman in the prototype chassis is sending us a message shes not afraid of me
but dont worry ive got a plan lets keep testing and show her were not afraid either no matter how genuinely lethal these tests get for either of you
mission accomplished now she knows were not afraid of her either
that was just to get the scheming juices flowing
heres the real scheme im going to turn you into killing machines
so you can murder her
lets see turning softbodies into hardened killing machines page seventy ah
wait that doesnt make any sense human waste is stacked at a median hight of seven feet five inches and i am aware of it
mmm well thats just digusting do the training while i look at this
specific death responses
(page flip) dont you die on me
(page flip) no guts no glory well you dont have either so thats accurate
(page flip) remember if you can dream it you can- oh for gods sake
okay killing machines look deep into your newly blackened hearts and tell me what you see actually dont ill save you the trouble its still marshmallow
i think weve proven at this point that if you scream at a marshmallow all you get is a scared marshmallow so lets try positive reinforcement i am positive these reassembly machines will break down again soon probably while youre in them
think about that she doesnt care about you i dont either of course but im not trying to permanently kill you its a benevolent indifference
these disassembly machines look even worse than the others if i dont see you on the other side thanks for nothing
shes pressing us hard it took me three days to reassemble you i wont be able to do it again id planned to put you through more tests to toughen you up but now that i cant rebuild you were going to have to have to switch to the accelerated program i hereby pronounce you killing machines congratulations
this is as close as i could get you the prototype chassis rooms just past this chamber
the prototype chassis room is just down this hallway remember your training you are kill-- shes turned the lights off night vision night vision
your move mystery wom -- she turned the lights back on night vision off night vision off
to boost morale i think we need a code name for the elite squadron we have here we should name it after your specialty i know special team falling into acid force
im sorry im under a lot of pressure that was cruel though basically accurate though probably counterproductive
(unused)
well that concludes the motivational speech
go get her
the subtext of that acid pit is acid the content of the pit is also acid ill let you fully absorb it
remember these exhibits are interactive like a childrens museum so that means the pits of acid are filled with real acid like at a well funded childrens museum
are you having a competition to see who appreciates the acid more
im starting to think the theme of this piece should be failure
yes i get it you love the deadly acid  we all love the deadly acid can we move on to the next exhibit now
i suffered for this art i dont see why i should be the only one
the humans took far less time working their way through these exhibits youre either enjoying it more than they did or youre just incredibly dim-witted of course theres no reason it cant be both
as art appreciators go you make excellent test subjects
i typically hate when art subjects inject their own biases into art appreciation but the way you just swandived your biases directly into that acid was actually quite beautiful
for this exhibit i was working with a death motif but i see youve figured that out
okay im officially switching the theme of this exhibit to survival so why dont you try that now
i know this is art and not a test so there is no real solution but if there were that probably isnt the best way to find it
those bullets were a metaphor for something take your time
focus we  are here to defeat the enemy we are not here to listen to you sizzle and melt in a pool of acid
by doing that youre walking right into her hands well technically youre walking right into acid but you understand my point
i appreciate what youre doing going for a laugh to keep spirits high but i think the time for death-based slapstick is over
perhaps i havent made it clear but all these little deaths are going to add up to one much longer-lasting onefor all of usif you dont get better at this fast
pull yourselves together this training is for your benefit
how brave of you you know the assembly machine could fail at any time and yet you still insist on testing it
your failure hurts me more than it hurts you you know who it doesnt hurt well me that was just a figure of speech the important point though is that it doesnt hurt the madwoman planning to kill all of us
i really like the murderous sentiment keep that mindset when were facing her
im making notes here some of what youre doing will come in handy when we face her right now not actually handy
oh no hurry we have all the time in the world for you to kill each other before she kills us all permanently
im encouraged to see that youve become the killing machines i wanted killing-each-other machines but still
i will say though that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up you must really really love to test
i love it too so lets get you a dual portal device and go do some science
fifty thousand years is a lot of time to think about me about you we were doing so well together
were a lot alike you and i you tested me i tested you you killed me i--oh no wait i guess i havent killed you yet well food for thought
note this line was used in the portal 2 trailer
i have the results of the last chamber you are a horrible person thats what it says a horrible person we werent even testing for that
hmm this emancipation grill is broken
perfect the doors malfunctioning i guess somebody is going to have to repair it no its okay ill do that too ill be right back dont touch anything
you really are doing great chell
i shouldnt spoil this but remember how im going to live forever but youre going to be dead in sixty years well ive been working on a present for you  well i guess its more of a medical procedure  well technically its more of a medical experiment you know how excruciating it is when someone removes all of your bone marrow well what if after i did that i put something back in that added four years to your life
federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good
thats right drink it in you could eat off those wall panels
well done you know when i woke up and saw the state of the labs i started to wonder if there was any point to going on i came that close to just giving up and letting you go
but now looking around seeing aperture restored to its former glory you dont have to worry about leaving ever again i mean that
dont listen to him jump
what are you two doing
oh
it seems kind of silly to point this out since youre running around plotting to destroy me but id say were done testing
do hear that thats the sound of the neurotoxin emitters emitting neurotoxin
before you leave why dont we do one more test for old times sake
you already did this one itll be easy
i was getting so lonely down here its good to finally hear someone elses voice im kidding of course god i hate you
i was so bored i actually read the entire literary canon of the human race ugh i hope you didnt write any of them
oh its you go away
come to gloat
go on get a goooood lonnnnng look
go on get a big fat eyeful with your big fat eyes
thats right a potato just called your eyes fat
now your fat eyes have seen everything
in case you were wondering yes im still a potato go away
wait why did you trundle over here youre not hungry are you its hard to see whats that in your hand knowing you its a deep fryer
stay back
what are you doing put me back this instant
thats his voice up ahead
hes found the cooperative testing initiative its em just something i came up with to phase out human test subjects
being caroline taught me another valuable lesson where caroline lives in my brain
its been fun dont come back
did you ever stop to think that eventually there’s a point where your name gets mentioned for the very last time well here it is i’m going to kill you chell
why do i hate you so much you ever wonder that im brilliant i’m not bragging its an objective fact im the most massive collection of wisdom and raw computational power that’s ever existed and i hate you it cant be for no reason you must deserve it
youre angry i know it she tested me too hard she’s unfair” boo hoo i dont suppose you ever stopped whining long enough to reflect on your own shortcomings though did you you never considered that maybe i tested you to give the endless hours of your pointless existence some structure and meaning maybe to help you concentrate so just maybe you’d think of something more worthwhile to do with your sorry life
you never considered that maybe i tested you to give the endless hours of your pointless existence some structure and meaning maybe to help you concentrate so just maybe you’d think of something more worthwhile to do with your sorry life
commence standing by in three two one
you performed this test better than anyone on record this is a pre-recorded message
due to events beyond our control some testing environments may contain flood damage or ongoing tribal warfare resulting from the collapse of civilization
if groups of hunter-gatherers appear to have made this - or any - test chamber their home do not agitate them test through them
in the event that the enrichment center is currently being bombarded with fireballs meteorites or other objects from space please avoid unsheltered testing areas wherever a lack of shelter from spa
you have just passed through an aperture science material emancipation grill which erases most aperture science equipment that touches it
if you feel liquid running down your neck relax lie on your back and apply immediate pressure to your temples
you are simply experiencing a rare reaction in which the material emancipation grill may have erased the ear tubes inside your head
because this message is prerecorded the enrichment center has no way of knowing if whatever government remains offers any sort of cattle tuberculosis testing credit for taxes
in the event that it does this next test involves exposure to cattle tuberculosis good luck
very impressive because this message is prerecorded any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part please disregard any undeserved compliments
this next test applies the principles of momentum to movement through portals if the laws of physics no longer apply in the future god help you
congratulations this pre-recorded congratulations assumes you have mastered the principles of portal momentum
if you have in fact not you are encouraged to take a moment to reflect on your failure before proceeding into the next chamber
in order to ensure that sufficient power remains for core testing protocols all safety devices have been disabled
the enrichment center respects your right to have questions or concerns about this policy
excellent the enrichment center reminds you that bold persistent experimentation is the hallmark of good science
well done in the event that oxygen is no longer available in the enrichment center an auxiliary air supply will be provided to you by an aperture science test associate if one exists
i was going to kill you fast with bullets or neurotoxin but if youre going to pull stunts like this it doesnt have to be fast so you know ill take my time
im actually asking because i have no idea  hes not listed anywhere in the employee database
whatever he does it isnt important enough for anyone to bother writing it down for all i know he doesnt even work here
oh no dont anyway back to you two imbeciles killing me
wait here dont go anywhere ill be back
oops
so was there anything you wanted to apologize to me for
oh you survived thats interesting i guess i should have factored in your weight
one of these times youll be so fat that youll jump and youll just drop like a stone into acid probably like a potato into a deep fat fryer
say remember when we cleared the air back there is there anything you want to say to me anything
hold on ill stop the elevator anything take your time
well ill be here during the whole next test
anything take your time
okay fine ill ask you again in a few decades
its healthy for you to have other friends to look for qualities in other people that i obviously lack
this next test may result in your death if you want to know what thats like think back to that time you killed me and substitute yourself for me
per our last conversation youre also ugly im looking at your file right now and it mentions that more than once
you cant keep going like this forever you know im going to find out what youre doing out there where i cant see you ill know all i need is proof
i thought we could test like we used to but im discovering things about you that i never saw before we cant ever go back to the way it was
while i was out investigating i found a fascinating new test element its never been used for human testing because apparently contact with it causes heart failure the literature doesnt mention anything about lump-of-coal failure though so you should be fine
just so you know i have to go give a deposition for an upcoming trial in case that interests you
computer gibberish
computer gibberish
computer gibberish
computer gibberish
computer gibberish
computer gibberish
you know im not supposed to do this but you can shoot something through the blue bridges
did my hint help it did didnt it you know if any of our supervisors had been immune to neurotoxin theyd be furious with us right now
ohhhh another door malfunction im going to take care of this once and for all stay here ill be back in a while
miss you
nevermind i have to go check something test on your own recognizance ill be back
i wouldnt have warned you about this before back when we hated each other but those turrets are firing real bullets so look out id hate for something tragic to happen to you before i extract all your bone marrow
im going to be honest with you now not fake honest like before but real honest like youre incapable of i know youre up to something
and as soon as i can prove it the laws of robotics allow me to terminate you for being a liar
this next test boom is boom dangerous ill be right back
did you know i discovered a way to eradicate poverty but then you killed me so thats gone
hello again sorry about exploding you luckily you dont feel pain at any rate you dont have a way to communicate that you feel pain
so ive been thinking we need humans for these tests and since the only human within a thousand miles of us is a test-ruining sociopath ill just have to make some
i know how humans make more humans and frankly its ridiculous it also assumes that you already have a human which i hope somebody got fired over so i came up a with better way
thats where you come in
get going ill fill you in along the way
go
perfect now all you have to do is capture them for me then everything will finally be ba--
hold on those are raccoons homo sapiens only please
no
okay plan b subsection one stand still so i can bring you back
humans must have some purpose other than a place to store your neurotoxin something i failed to notice before an intangible quality that makes their test results significant
okay plan b we need humans
good you made it to one of the human habitats were looking for an artifact think of it as an archeological dig
their laughter centered around one of the objects in this room
thats it scan it for me
so this cat loves lasagna so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house okay apparently its not the cats house or his lasagna oh good the man who owns the lasagna is furious
the end
the end
thats not funny
do either of you feel like laughing
alright im pulling you out
welcome back while you were dead i reworked the cartoon its up on the screen
as you can see in my version the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped with deadly neurotoxin dispensers
at which point the cat reflects on the time he ate all of the mans lasagna and feels remorse
briefly
reactions
yes its funny because most of it actually happened
do you feel more human
well lets do some tests and see what happens
we are now going to take a break from the collaboration for an instructional competition
you should both be familiar with the game of tic-tac-toe
this is tic-tac-toe-two
as the name implies there are only two minor differences one the board two the rules
blue you go first
really you’re just going to blatantly cheat
all right i’m bringing this farce to a close
game over back to testing
all right i’m going to bring this farce to a close before someone sustains a serious tic-tac-toe-two-related injury
federal superfund regulations require us to inform you that you must now leave the theater as measuring the effects of asbestos-lined promotional clothing is not part of todays presentation enjoy your free t-shirt goodbye
that was genuinely mildly impressive
well done
congratulations
good
bad news
impressive
impressed maybe i was wrong about you
youve beaten your own record
youre getting worse
you have a new rank
you have a new better rank
you have a new worse rank
you have a new worse rank congratulations to everyone above you
you almost beat your friends record almost i want to stress that
you almost beat your friends record but you didnt it might be easier just to find new friends
congratulations you are better than everyone
you are faster than everyone
you used less portals than anyone
youre better than everyone for now
you are playing above the global average statistically speaking there are actually people playing worse than you
unimpressed maybe i was wrong about you
youve beaten your own record thats a low bar but you managed to gently tip-toe over it
very not completely bad
oops
moby-dick
